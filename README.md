# how-to-bash

## Useful commands

- `pwd` will show you at what path are you in at the moment
- `mkdir new-dir-name` will create a new directory/folder named `new-dir-name`
- `cd new-dir-name` will change the directory (remember that cd stand for Change Directory) to new-dir-name
- `touch new-file.txt` will create a new file called `new-file.txt`
- `echo "Hi there" > new-file.txt` will replace the file's contents with "Hi there" in a file named `new-file.txt`. If no such file existed prior to the command it will create a new file.
- `echo "Hi there" >> new-file.txt` will add to the existing file's content a new line with "Hi there". If no such file existed prior to the command it will create a new file.

## Useful shortcuts (on OSX)
